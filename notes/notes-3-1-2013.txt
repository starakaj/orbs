The story so far:

vb.stretch~ is awesome.
It would be nice to figure out a way of triggering that was more sensitive to sudden offsets.

1) Reverb
 - Use the CSP
 - "Ground Zero", the normal environment. A bigger room than the one we're actually in, one that we can actually close our eyes and describe.
 - Investigate using recorded sounds to recreate that space
 - Investigate using a real reverb
 - Hagia Sophia
